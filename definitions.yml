        Payment Date.

    Modification Event:
    - !!python/tuple
      - 1857
      - A "Modification Event" with respect to any Reference Obligation is a forbearance
        or certain mortgage rate modifications relating to such Reference Obligation,
        it being understood that in the absence of a forbearance or certain mortgage
        rate modifications, a term extension on a Reference Obligation will not constitute
        a Modification Event.
    - &id779 !!python/tuple
      - 1858
      - 'In addition, a mortgage rate modification that results in an increased mortgage
        rate with respect to any Reference Obligation (after giving effect to all
        scheduled mortgage rate modifications thereon) will not constitute a "Modification
        Event." For example, in the case of a mortgage rate modification that provides
        for a mortgage rate reduction from 4% to 2% followed by a future step-up in
        the mortgage rate from 2% to 5%, the modification will not be treated as a
        "Modification Event." By contrast, in the case of a mortgage rate modification
        that provides for a mortgage rate reduction from 4% to 2% followed by a future
        step-up in the mortgage rate from 2% back to 4%, the modification will be
        treated as a "Modification Event." The "Modification Loss Amount" with respect
        to each Payment Date and any Reference Obligation that has experienced a Modification
        Event is the excess, if any, of: (a) one-twelfth of the Original Accrual Rate
        multiplied by the UPB of such Reference Obligation, over (b) one-twelfth of
        the Current Accrual Rate multiplied by the interest bearing UPB of such Reference
        Obligation.'

        proceeds of any mortgage insurance covering such Reference Obligation at the
        time such Reference Obligation became a Credit Event Reference Obligation,
        without regard to whether such amount or any portion thereof is actually received
