Modification Eventxyz1857xyzA "Modification Event" with respect to any Reference Obligation is a forbearance or certain mortgage rate modifications relating to such Reference Obligation, it being understood that in the absence of a forbearance or certain mortgage rate modifications, a term extension on a Reference Obligation will not constitute a Modification Event.
Modification Eventxyz1858xyzIn addition, a mortgage rate modification that results in an increased mortgage rate with respect to any Reference Obligation (after giving effect to all scheduled mortgage rate modifications thereon) will not constitute a "Modification Event." For example, in the case of a mortgage rate modification that provides for a mortgage rate reduction from 4% to 2% followed by a future step-up in the mortgage rate from 2% to 5%, the modification will not be treated as a "Modification Event." By contrast, in the case of a mortgage rate modification that provides for a mortgage rate reduction from 4% to 2% followed by a future step-up in the mortgage rate from 2% back to 4%, the modification will be treated as a "Modification Event." The "Modification Loss Amount" with respect to each Payment Date and any Reference Obligation that has experienced a Modification Event is the excess, if any, of: (a) one-twelfth of the Original Accrual Rate multiplied by the UPB of such Reference Obligation, over (b) one-twelfth of the Current Accrual Rate multiplied by the interest bearing UPB of such Reference Obligation.

Mortgage Insurance Credit Amountxyz1859xyzThe "Mortgage Insurance Credit Amount" with respect to any Credit Event Reference Obligation is the full amount, if any, that may be claimed as contractual proceeds of any mortgage insurance covering such Reference Obligation at the time such Reference Obligation became a Credit Event Reference Obligation, without regard to whether such amount or any portion thereof is actually received by or reimbursed to Fannie Mae from the applicable mortgage insurer, servicer or any other source.
